# List of evidence

An additional file that lists all the evidence in the input file is output by default in `evidence.md`.

See [examples/evidence.md](examples/evidence.md) for an example.

The format can be used in Markdown and reStructuredText files.

If the list of evidence should not be output, use the `-E` option.

You can use the `-e` option to rename the standard `evidence.md` to another file name, but not subdirectory.
The `-o` option also applies to the evidence file.


## Markdown from `examples/evidence.md`

{{#include examples/evidence.md}}
