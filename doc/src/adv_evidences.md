# List of evidences

An additional file that lists all the evidences in the input file is output by default in `evidences.md`.

See [examples/evidences.md](examples/evidences.md) for an example.

The format can be used in Markdown and reStructuredText files.

If the list of evidences should not be output, use the `-E` option.

You can use the `-e` option to rename the standard `evidences.md` to another file name, but not subdirectory.
The `-o` option also applies to the evidences file.


## Markdown from `examples/evidences.md`

{{#include examples/evidences.md}}
