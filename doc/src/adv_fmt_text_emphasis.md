# Text emphasis

You can use `*` and `_` to emphasize text.

Text enclosed in `*`'s will be assigned a CSS class "bold".

Text enclosed in `_`'s will be assigned a CSS class "italic".

A default inline style is also assigned.

## Example

This text:

```
This is a *bold* text. This is an _italic_ text.
```

will be rendered to:

`This is a`**`bold`**`text. This is an`*`italic`*`text.`
